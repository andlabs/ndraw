This library is in its infancy. So far, this is all it can do:

and can only do this on Unix, where it uses cairo (>=1.10) and pango (>=1.30). This is everything I personally need to get started doing what I want to do, but the testmain.go file should give a fair idea of what using this library will be like when, and if, I do finish it.
